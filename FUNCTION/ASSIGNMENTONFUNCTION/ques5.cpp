/*The minimum number of functions present in any C++ program is:
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Infinite*/

/*
The correct answer is b) 1. 

Every C++ program must have at least one function, which is the **main()** function. This function is the entry point of the program where execution begins. Without a **main()** function, the program won't compile or run. Additional functions can be added as needed, but a minimum of one is always required.
