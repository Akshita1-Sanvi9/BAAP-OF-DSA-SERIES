/*
State True and False:
a) A function may be called more than once from any other function
b) It is necessary for a function to return some value.
*/

/*
Here are the answers:

a) True - A function can be called multiple times from another function or even from itself (in the case of recursion). This is one of the core features of functions, as they help reuse code and simplify programs.

b) False - It is not necessary for a function to return a value. Functions can have a return type of `void`, meaning they perform actions without returning anything. For example, functions used for printing output may not return any value.
