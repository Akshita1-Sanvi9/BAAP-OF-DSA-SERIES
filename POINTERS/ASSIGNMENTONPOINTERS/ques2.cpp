/*
int *p, q;
a) p is a pointer and q is an integer.
b) p and q both are pointers.
c) P and q both are integers.
d) Syntax is incorrect.
*/

/*
The correct answer is **a) p is a pointer and q is an integer**.

In the declaration `int *p, q;`, the `*` indicates that `p` is a pointer to an integer, while `q` is simply declared as an integer. The `*` only applies to the variable immediately following itâ€”in this case, `p`.
