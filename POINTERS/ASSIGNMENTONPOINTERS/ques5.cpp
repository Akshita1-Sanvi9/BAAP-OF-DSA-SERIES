/*
The program snippet is not correct and will likely result in undefined behavior. Here's why:

Pointer Initialization:

You declared a pointer int *ptr; but did not initialize it. It is pointing to a random memory location (a "garbage address").

When you try to assign a value (*ptr = 5;), the program attempts to write to that random memory location, which can cause a segmentation fault or other runtime error.
